You can use FirstQuadrant's AI to further qualify your audience to hyper-target the right contacts. This feature allows you to find the most relevant contacts for your campaigns by using AI to enrich the data. This will help you to improve your targeting and increase your conversion rates.

## Default qualification criteria

FirstQuadrant uses the following default qualification criteria to qualify your audience.

### Company and contact are enriched

FirstQuadrant uses AI to enrich the company and contact data. This includes enriching the company data with information such as the company's size, industry, location, revenue, and funding. The contact data is enriched with information such as the contact's job title, management position, employer, and location.

By default, the following criteria are used to qualify your audience:

- **Company name is known:** The name of this company is known.
- **Company website is available:** Ensure that the primary domain of the company is known and their website is currently active. This helps to ensure that the company is still in business and is a good proxy for the company's activity.
- **Company description is generated:** Ensure that FirstQuadrant was able to generate a description for the company by scraping their website. This is used for personalization and to ensure that the company is relevant to your campaign.
- **Name is known:** The name of the contact is known to ensure that the contact is a real person and we can personalize the outreach.
- **Email address is verified:** The email address of the contact is verified to ensure that the contact is reachable.

Additionally, you can use the following criteria to further qualify your audience if you are using any of the following details in your Sequence and would only like to target contacts that have these details:

- **Current job title is known:** Ensure that the current job title of the contact is known.
- **Location is known:** Ensure that the location of the contact is known.
- **Work history is known:** Ensure that the work history of the contact is known.
- **Personal email address is not used:** Ensure that the contact's personal email address is not used. This helps to ensure that the contact is reachable at their work email address.

### Exclude contacts from other campaigns

FirstQuadrant excludes contacts that are already in another campaign. This ensures that you don't target the same contacts multiple times and helps to prevent over-saturation. By default, all campaigns are considered when excluding contacts. You can choose to exclude contacts from specific campaigns.

## Filter questions

You can use AI to further qualify your audience by using filter questions. Filter questions are yes-no questions that help you to filter out contacts that don't meet your criteria. You can use filter questions to further qualify your audience based on very specific criteria.

For example, if you are a business that sells remote work software, you may only want to target companies that offer remote or hybrid work options to their employees. You can create a filter question "Does this company offer remote or hybrid work options?" and FirstQuadrant will use AI to answer this question for each contact and only include contacts that meet your criteria.

By default, all contacts that answer the filter question with "Yes" will be included in your audience. You can choose to include contacts that answer the filter question with "No" to filter by negative criteria.

Under the hood, FirstQuadrant conducts a web search to find the answer to the filter question. This is done by using AI to analyze the company's website, news articles, and other sources.
