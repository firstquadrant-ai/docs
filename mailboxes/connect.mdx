## Connect a mailbox

Visit Settings -> Mailboxes and click on **Create mailbox** to connect a mailbox to your FirstQuadrant team. Enter the required information and click "Connect mailbox". For example, to add the email address `jane@example.com`:

1. Local: The local part of the email address, e.g. `jane`
1. Domain: Select the domain part of the email address, e.g. `example.com`
1. Team member: Select the team member who will be using this mailbox
1. Provider: Select the email provider, e.g. Google Workspace
1. You will be redirected to your email provider to authorize FirstQuadrant to access your mailbox

After adding a mailbox, click on "Set up warming"; this is a critical step to ensure your emails are delivered to the inbox. Follow the instructions below to set up email warming.

## App passwords

To set up [Email warming](/mailboxes/email-warming), FirstQuadrant requires access to your email accounts. We recommend creating app passwords for each email account you want to use with FirstQuadrant. This will allow you to revoke access to FirstQuadrant without changing your email account password.

### Turn on 2-step verification

To create app passwords, you must first turn on 2-step verification for your Google account. This is a security feature that requires you to verify your identity using a second method, such as your phone or a security key, when signing in to your account:

1. Log in to and open your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com)
1. In the navigation panel, select **Security**
1. Under "Signing in to Google," select 2-Step Verification and then **Get started**
1. Follow the on-screen steps

For more information, see [Turn on 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?) on Google's support documentation.

### Create an app password

1. On the FirstQuadrant "Mailboxes" settings page, click on **Set up warming**
1. In a different tab, go to your Google Account
1. Select **Security**
1. Under "Signing in to Google," select **App Passwords**; if you can't find it, you can use the search bar
1. At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose "Mail" and then Select device and enter "FirstQuadrant", then click **Generate**
1. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device, enter this code in FirstQuadrant

For more information, see [Sign in using App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) on Google's support documentation.

  Google automatically revokes your app passwords when you change your Google
  Account password; make sure to update your app passwords when you change your
  Google Account password.
