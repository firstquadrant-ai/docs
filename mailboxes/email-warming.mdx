## Setting up email warming

FirstQuadrant automatically sets up email warming for all connected mailboxes after you add an [App password](/mailboxes/connect#app-passwords) to your mailbox. After initialization, it usually takes between 5 seconds and 2 hours to see the first interaction, which could be the first email sent or received, and for your [Reputation score](/mailboxes/reputation-score) to be available.

Upon set up, FirstQuadrant will automatically create a folder called "To Follow" in your inbox. This folder will store all the warming emails, both sent and received, so they don't clutter your inbox. By default, FirstQuadrant gradually increases the number of daily warming emails sent from your mailbox until it reaches around 40 to 50 every day, for both email warming emails and outbound emails.
