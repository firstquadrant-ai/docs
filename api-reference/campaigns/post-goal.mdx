title: Create a goal completion
openapi: POST /api/teams/{teamId}/campaigns/goal
---

This endpoint is used to mark a campaign contact as "won" using the API.

You are required to provide the goal, for example "meeting scheduled", and we will find the contact in the most recent campaign with that goal and mark them as "won". You also need to provide a way to find the contact, for example by email, ID, or nested custom data (any one of the fields is required).
