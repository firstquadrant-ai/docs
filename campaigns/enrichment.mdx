You can use FirstQuadrant's AI to enrich additional information about the prospect's company, so you can include very specific questions in your outreach.

To create a new enrichment, click on the "Add enrichment" button under "Enrichments" in the Sequence step of creating or updating a campaign. You can include the Field name and Description. Here are some examples of enrichments you may create:

| Field name  | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mission     | Mission of the company                                   |
| CEO         | Name of the CEO of the company                           |
| New product | Name of the latest product announcement from the company |
| Investors   | Names of the funds that have invested in the company     |

You can then include this enriched information into your Sequence, for example:

> Hi \{first name}, I noticed that \{company} recently announced a new product called \{new product}. I'm curious to know how this fits in the overall strategy put together by \{CEO's name}.
